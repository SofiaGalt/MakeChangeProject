## Make Change Project
My first weekend project for Skill Distillery.

### Description
An app that calculates the change for a transaction.

The user is first prompted for the total price; then offered the choice between two methods for giving the amount tendered. After amount tendered has been collected, the appropriate change is generated and returned to the user.

### Topics and Technologies used
Scanner, methods, assignment and comparison operators, comments, if statements, LinkedLists, for loop, Math.round, type conversion operator, javadoc annotations.

### How to run
Give requested info for:
  1)  The transaction total
  2)  The desired method of giving the money tendered, either (1) input the total amount tendered, or (2) input the individula numbers of bills /coins in use per currency denomination for the given transaction individually.
  3)  Either (1) the total amount of currency tendered or (2) the number of bills/ coins in use per currency denomination; as per your choice in step two.

  If the amount tendered is less than the cost, the message "Funds not sufficient." will be sent to the console.
  If the amount tendered is exactly the same as cost, "Amount tendered exactly covers the cost.  Transaction complete." will be output to the console.
  If the amount tendered is greater than the cost, the change to be give back to the customer is generated.  The change will be provided using the largest bill and coin denominations as possible.
  
### Lessons Learned
Learned how to avoid certain problem when using floating point numbers.
